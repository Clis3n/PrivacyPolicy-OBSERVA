            you may turn them off in your device's settings.</li>
    </ul>

        troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
    <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of

    <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>

        preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our

        <li><strong>Location Data.</strong> We collect location data such as information about your device's location,
            which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings
            of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect
            geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing
            us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location
            setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the
            Services.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="do-we-use-cookies-and-other-tracking-technologies">4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
    </h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your
        information.</p>
    <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you
        interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services and
        your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>
    <p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for
        analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your
        interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third
        parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored
        to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>
    <p>To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a "sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted

        online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section 'DO UNITED STATES

    <h2 id="how-do-we-handle-your-social-logins">5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we
        may have access to certain information about you.</p>
    <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details
        (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about
        you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media
        provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well
        as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
    <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that
        are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
        responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend
        that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information,
        and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

    <h2 id="how-long-do-we-keep-your-information">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in
        this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
        Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
        other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
        longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
        further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h2 id="how-do-we-keep-your-information-safe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and
        technical security measures.</p>
    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect
        the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
        be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third
        parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
        environment.</p>

    <h2 id="what-are-your-privacy-rights">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your
        country, province, or state of residence.</p>
    <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
        information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to
        withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the
        contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.</p>
    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when
        applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
        lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
    <p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
    <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you
        can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our
        active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems,
        assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you

        feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
        browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and
        implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
        other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
        tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
        version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
    <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is
        not an industry or legal standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this
        time.</p>
